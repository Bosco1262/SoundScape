# SoundScape

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

A location-based map app where users can propose and vote on background music (BGM) for specific places. The app automatically plays the top-voted music when a user enters a tagged area, creating a collective, real-world soundtrack.

## Overview

Have you ever walked through a park and thought, "This place would be perfect with a certain song"? SoundScape brings this idea to life. It's a social experiment in auditory-geographical association, allowing communities to collectively decide the soundtrack for their physical environment.

Using a map-based interface, you can tag any location—a coffee shop, a scenic viewpoint, a quiet street—and suggest a song that captures its essence. Other users can vote on these suggestions. When you physically enter an area with a top-voted soundtrack, the music begins to play, immersing you in a shared, location-based soundscape.

## Core Features

-   **🗺️ Interactive Map**: Discover and explore locations tagged with music by other users.
-   **🎵 Propose Music**: Tag any place on the map and propose a song that fits its atmosphere.
-   **👍 Vote on Soundtracks**: Influence your local soundscape by upvoting or downvoting music suggestions for different places.
-   **🎧 Automatic Playback**: Using geofencing technology, the app detects when you enter a tagged zone and automatically plays the winning soundtrack.
-   **🏆 Leaderboards**: See which songs are trending in your city and which users are the top "SoundScape Architects."
-   **👤 User Profiles**: Track your proposals, votes, and the places you've discovered.

## Technical Stack

The project will be built using modern web and mobile technologies:

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for a responsive and cross-platform user experience.
-   **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a lightweight and scalable server.
-   **Database**: A NoSQL database like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store user data, locations, and votes.
-   **Mapping & Geofencing**: Integration with map services (like Mapbox or Google Maps) and geofencing APIs to handle location tracking and triggers.
-   **Music Service**: Connection to a music streaming API (like Spotify or Apple Music) for song data and playback.
